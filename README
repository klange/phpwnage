Version 1.8

Welcome to PHPwnage, a light, powerful, customizable, and open source 
forum, blog, and calendar for PHP! Please take the time to read INSTALL 
for instructions on installing PHPwnage. PHPwnage started out as a 
personal project for my own website (oasis-games.com) and was later 
expanded to add more features common in other forums. It is easy to 
install and use (as well as customize!), and you are free to make any 
modifications you wish under the GPL.

This is release version 1.8 (September, 2008). It is the first 
official GPL release and contains tons of new improvements over 1.7 
and other previous versions.

ReCAPTCHA notice:
PHPwnage comes packaged with the ReCAPTCHA PHP library. The license for the
ReCaptcha license can be found in the file 'recaptchalib.php'.

Tango notice:
PHPwnage uses icons from the Tango Desktop Project. These icons are
currently distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike
license. There are plans in place for these icons to be released under
the LGPL (GNU Lesser General Public License), but until that happens,
attribution must be made to the Tango Desktop Project for the included icons.
(For more information on the Tango Desktop Project, visit

with these terms, remove the directory "tango/" and the file
"icons_themes/tango.php" from your installation.
