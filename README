Welcome to PHPwnage, a light, powerful, customizable, and open source 
forum, blog, and calendar for PHP! Please take the time to read INSTALL 
for instructions on installing PHPwnage. PHPwnage started out as a 
personal project for my own website (oasis-games.com) and was later 
expanded to add more features common in other forums. It is easy to 
install and use (as well as customize!), and you are free to make any 
modifications you wish under the GPL.

This is release version 1.8 (UNRELEASED, 2008). It is the first 
official GPL release and contains tons of new improvements over 1.7 
and other previous versions.

ReCAPTCHA notice:
PHPwnage comes packaged with the ReCAPTCHA PHP library. The license for the
ReCaptcha license can be found in the file 'recaptchalib.php'.

CHANGELOG:
1.8 - 
 + Moved all static text to a single file (lang/enUS.php)
 + Moved all redirects and "Go Back" messages to a separate method, now with theming
 + Made polls systematic, they can now have as many options as you want (separated,with,commas)
 + Fixed some bugs left over from 1.7.1
 + Made some improvements to the installer
 + New Crystal theme
 + Fixed RSS feeds with Firefox
 + Integrated ReCAPTCHA (optional)

 + So many things that they just don't all fit here in the changelog, please take a look at the
   commit history on Launchpad for a complete listing of changes.
