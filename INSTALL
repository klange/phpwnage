Installation instructions for PHPwnage News, Forum and Calendar
PHPwnage requires that you have a working MySQL server and at least one 
available database. If the database you select does not exist, PHPwnage 
will attempt to create it, but will most likely fail. Your server must 
also be set up to allow PHP to write to a new file. If it is not, you 
must manually edit fresh_install.php to enable direct output of the 
generated config file to the HTML stream (search for 
'Create_File_Failed' where you will find instructions on fixing the 
problem). PHPwnage is designed for PHP 5 but may work on PHP 4 (but it 
is not supported in any way on PHP 4). Once you are sure that you have 
your MySQL and PHP set up properly, navigate to 'fresh_install.php' on
your web browser and follow the instructions shown.

Things to do after installing:
1. Set up a forum. This is the real purpose of PHPwnage. You can do 
   this in the admin control panel.
2. Set up blocks.
3. Add a favicon. Nothing improves the look of a site more than a 
   little definitive icon.
4. Fill in your ReCAPTCHA keys to improve security on your forum.
